Touch Maze is a simple android game where the player uses their finger to move a dot to avoid oncoming obstacles. The game was built using the libGDX libraries and acted as a learning introduction program for both getting into android development and libGDX.

The application has been discontinued for now; however, it still acts as a prototype for a game I could potentially continue building at some point.
